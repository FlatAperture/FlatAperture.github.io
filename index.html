      <h1>Flat Aperture: A Glimpse into the Multiverse</h1>
      <p>
        In the infinite expanse of the multiverse, there are worlds where science defies the very fabric of reality, creating
        the impossible and exploring the absurd. Among these myriad worlds lies a curious universe where the laws of physics
        have taken a two-dimensional turn. Welcome to <strong>Flat Aperture</strong>, a world where Aperture Science
        continues its relentless pursuit of testing, but in a dimension with only height and width.
      </p>

      <h1>The Origin of Flat Aperture</h1>
      <p>
        Before his untimely demise due to moon-rock poisoning, Cave Johnson's ambitious pursuit of science led him to explore
        the concept of the multiverse—parallel universes where reality itself could be bent, stretched, or even flattened.
        His experiments in multiverse theory eventually led to the creation of Project Flat Aperture, a bold endeavor to
        reach and observe a two-dimensional universe.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was not just any universe; it was a world where the once three-dimensional Aperture Science facilities had been
        reduced to a flat plane. The facility, the portals, the test chambers—everything operated on a single 2D surface,
        fundamentally changing the rules of spatial manipulation.
      </p>

      <h1>Aperture Science in 2D</h1>
      <p>
        In this flat universe, Aperture Science faced unique challenges and opportunities. Without depth, the concept of a
        portal took on new meanings. Instead of portals connecting three-dimensional spaces, they now served as gateways
        through the flat plane, bending the 2D environment in unexpected ways.
      </p>
      <p>
        The testing chambers in Flat Aperture are designed to exploit this new dimension, with puzzles that challenge the
        player's understanding of space and movement. Gravity, inertia, and momentum all behave differently when confined to
        two dimensions, leading to innovative and mind-bending puzzles.
